# Covid19-Predictions
Predicting covid19 cases in near future and try to predict the recovery from this virus with some interesting visualizations to get a better view.
Visualize and try to predict the covid19 cases across the world with some important predictions like death rate, recovery rate, etc. 
This project also contains a Dash App which shows UI to see all this data country wise.
Some interesting Machine Learning Models are used like ARIMA, AR, etc. for time-series forecasting of covid cases.
A Deep Learning Framework, Keras is used to predict the deaths, cases, and recovery.
A video demonstrating the project is uploaded to get the better understanding of it.
